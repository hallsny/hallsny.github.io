#### Payload Separation
* Designed, tested, and helped manufacture an extremely reliable quick disconnect for end of life balloon operation
* This was achieved by designing a device that is not affected by CTE changes, manufacturing variation, and high load cases
* To date the device has zero failures after extensive use in production
