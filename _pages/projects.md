# Waymo nozzle development
* Proposed and implemented a move of nozzle development in-house to minimize development schedule
* Designed and validated several unique spray fan designs, all with integrated check valves, quick interconnects, and custom fan angles and spray pattern  
* Managed DFM and assembly process flow to bring 5+ nozzles into production, including the development of leak testing
# Loon ballast subsystem
* Designed, analyzed, tested and implemented two generations of ballast designs for the Loon system 
* Designed and tested a working magnetic valve PCBA to demonstrate an electromagnetic analog control system to compensate for manufacturing tolerances and temperature changes
* System design and mechanical design for in process and EOL test fixtures for contract manufacturing
# Balloon Launching
* Analysed several large steel structures with ANSYS to determine strength requirements and frequency behavior using FEA and modal analysis
* Designed and created two functional prototypes of a device with pneumatic logic to automate launch of a payload and balloon system 
# Payload Separation
* Designed, tested, and helped manufacture an extremely reliable quick disconnect for end of life balloon operation
* This was achieved by designing a device that is not affected by CTE changes, manufacturing variation, and high load cases
* To date the device has zero failures after extensive use in production
# Composite chassis analysis
* Completed static structural analysis of a composite vehicle chassis including honeycomb Nomex core, ply number and orientation in ANSYS Composite PrepPost. Investigated front and side impact for deformation and composite failure
