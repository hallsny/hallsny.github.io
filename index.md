## Experience

### __Waymo__, Senior Mechanical Engineer:  2018-2021  
* Due to increasing requirements on  sensor range, resolution, and accuracy, fouling management became a critical component of the waymo vehicle.  I own the roof cleaning systems on multiple vehicle types, including nozzles, wipers, and system layout for lidar and surround view cameras.
* To solve issues around increasing part count and manufacturing steps,  I proposed a modifed sensor layout + structure for semi truck roof mounted sensor assembly. This design was accepted as plan of record.
 {::comment} * Designed and validated a high pressure automotive fluid pump system {:/comment}
* Managed cleaning software features and specifications.
* Faced with long lead times ad a lack of existing nozzle that packaged within our vehicle , I developed injected molded geometry guidelines  for shear nozzles with custom spray fan angles and spread.
* Managed DFM and assembly process flow to bring 5+ nozzles into production, including on-site support of tooling vendor..
* Designed, validated, and patented a precision timed spray/puff solution to increase system efficiency for rotating sensors 
* To reduce the risk associated an open reliability issue I designed and validated manufacturing process to significantly increase rigiditiy of the system while still  allowing  for lidar adjustment in a fully assembled state.

### __Loon__, Mechanical Engineer: 2014-2018	
* In response to an open-ended request to extend super-pressure balloon life in the stratosphere, I designed and implemented a novel magnetic ballast that allowed ground control to automatically compensate for altitude loss due to helium leaks. On a low leak rate ballon, this system could increase the lifespan of a balloon by months, greatly decreasing amortized system cost.
* 30+ unique molded parts designed, analyzed, and implemented for various subsystems of the Loon flight system including balloon and payload. 
* In an effort to reduce payload structure assembly cost while maintaining excellent strength-to-weight ratio,  I designed and validated several carbon-plastic adhesive interfaces.
* Designed pneumatic systems and structures for payload handling during automatic balloon launching.
* 20+  ANSYS simulation projects including structural FEA, modal, and buckling analysis.

### __SpaceX__, Structural Engineer: 2013-2014	
* 6 month internship involving design, FEMAP/NASTRAN analysis, and manufacturing of spacecraft structures.
* Designed and built several aluminum weldments and machined mounts for the interior of the Dragon spacecraft.

### __Stanford Solar Car Project__, Stanford Undergraduate Research: 2013
* Managed internal CNC machine and programmed/machined several components for the 2013 solar car.
* FEA analysis of suspension and completed static structural analysis of a composite vehicle chassis including honeycomb Nomex core, ply number and orientation in ANSYS Composite PrepPost.

### __Education__
* Stanford University 2011-2013
